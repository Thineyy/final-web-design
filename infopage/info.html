              <b><h3>Introduction:</h3></b>
              <br>
              <p align="center">Air pollution remains a major contributor to health problems worldwide, 
                with noncommunicable diseases causing an increase in morbidity and mortality every year. 
                Industrialization has resulted in the discharge of large amounts of pollutants into the air, 
                negatively impacting human health and the ecosystem. The Philippines is ranked among the world's 
                most polluted countries, with high levels of air pollution increasing the risk of lung cancer, 
                heart disease, and respiratory infections. The development of air quality detectors, 
                such as sensors based on NarrowBand-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) network for smart cities, 
                has been proposed to overcome the challenges of air pollution. In this context, this paper 
                suggests studying the health effects of particle contaminants in the air in Cagayan de Oro City 
                and the need to develop air quality monitoring systems, such as the proposed system located inside 
                the University of Science of Technology of Southern Philippines, to reduce the risk of air pollutants 
                and provide air quality data to individuals. 
                <br> <br>
                To address the growing demand for integrated 
                air pollution measurements, this study aims to narrow the gap between ground-based and remote 
                sensing devices and provide reliable and feasible air quality monitoring assessments. 
                Through the proposed system, a graphical user interface (GUI) of air quality index will be accessible to students, 
                facilitators, and other personnel via a web server, allowing for the observation of 
                health-status related to air pollutants. Ultimately, this paper highlights the importance 
                of air quality monitoring systems in mitigating the negative effects of air pollution on 
                human health and the environment.</p>

                <b><h3>Significance of the Study:</h3></b>
                <br>
                <p align="center">This study is expected to provide valuable data not only for the general public but 
                  also for specific sectors, such as students and faculty in USTP who will benefit from being informed 
                  about air pollutants in the campus. Environmental and health professionals can use the study to 
                  develop better strategies to address air pollution-related problems. Moreover, other researchers 
                  can utilize the findings to expand their knowledge on environmental factors that contribute to air pollution. </p>
